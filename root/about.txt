== the Messager

When you feel you're alone
Cut off from this cruel world
Your instincts telling you to run
Listen to your heart
Those angel voices
They'll sing to you there'll be a guide back home

When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
It keeps us kind

When you've suffered enough
And your spirit is breaking
Your growing desperate from the fight

Remember you're loved
And you always will be
This melody will bring you right back home

When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
When Life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
